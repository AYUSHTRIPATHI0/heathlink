## Problem Statement

Most health apps track simple metrics—steps, calories, heart rate—but rarely interpret them into **personal, actionable insights**. Users are left staring at charts, unsure what to do next, and often miss the opportunity to prevent future health risks.

---

## Our Solution — **Health Sync**

Health Sync is an **AI-driven health companion** that doesn’t just monitor your health—it **understands**, **predicts**, and **guides** your wellness journey in real-time.

* Uses **Generative AI** to analyze trends, predict risks, and deliver customized prevention and improvement plans.
* Features a **smart, responsive conversational health bot** for real-time, contextual advice.

---

## Key Features

### 1. **AI Health Prediction**

* Predicts issues like nutrient deficiencies, stress accumulation, or poor sleep.
* Delivers early warnings with tailored preventive strategies.

### 2. **Advanced Health Tracking**

* Monitors calories, heart rate, sleep, steps, and hydration.
* Offers interactive dashboards to view daily, weekly, and monthly trends.

### 3. **Conversational Health Bot (Gemini AI-Powered)**

* Responds to natural language—text or voice.
* Gives personalized health advice informed by your stats and history.
* Builds future risk scenarios with tailored action plans.

### 4. **AI-Powered Dynamic To-Do List**

* Creates a responsive daily task list matching your health state.
* Features hydration reminders, recommended meals, activity targets.
* Adapts dynamically throughout the day.

### 5. **Health History & Insights**

* Logs past interactions, health metrics, and bot conversations.
* Serves intelligent recommendations based on your history for future accuracy.

## How Generative AI Powers Health Sync

### Context-Aware Coaching

Interprets queries like:

> “I’ve been feeling dizzy for the past 3 days. What should I do?”

Pulls your real-time health stats + history to generate evidence-based, customized advice—e.g., adjust hydration, tweak meals, or consult a doctor.

### Health Risk Prediction

Detects patterns from past logs to predict future health concerns and offers preventive plans.

### Adaptive Task Generation

Creates and evolves your wellness tasks throughout the day as your metrics change.

### Health Journey Memory

Remembers your past issues and uses them contextually for more accurate future guidance.

## Why Health Sync Stands Out

* **Proactive & Predictive**: Stops health issues before they escalate.
* **Highly Personalized**: Every recommendation adapts to your unique profile and history.
* **Engaging & Intuitive**: An interactive UI, conversational bot, and evolving task list keep you engaged.
