## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: HSL values reflecting tranquility and health, such as a muted blue (#77B5FE), hinting at a sense of trust and well-being.
- Background color: A very light, desaturated shade of the primary hue (#F0F8FF) to provide a calming backdrop.
- Accent color: A slightly brighter, analogous color like a light purple (#B0E2FF) for highlighting key interactive elements.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for a modern, neutral look that works well for both headlines and body text.
- Simple, clean line icons to represent health stats and navigation options, maintaining a minimalist aesthetic.
- Use a grid-based layout for the dashboard to ensure elements are well-organized and easily accessible.
- Subtle animations, like fade-in effects or smooth transitions, to enhance the user experience without being distracting.
